### Practical Application 2 for Certificate in machine learning. 
# Objective 
### In this assigment we were given a used car data set from Kaggle and asked to explain user car dealsers what drive the price of a car. 

# Findings
### Upon Analyzing over 295000 user car sales any applying machine learning alogorithms to the data we have found that the used car values are dependent on the below top 5 factors.

### Odometer: reading was the largest contributuer to price, more the reading lesser the price.
### Year :  older cars effect the price of the car, there are few exceptions but they are very small part of the data. 
### Fuel Type:  A car running on diesel also commands more price but this is not very important. 
### Car type : Sedan are also a popular choice of cars and hold thier car value. 
### Number of Cylinders: The more the car has cylinders the price of the car increased. 
### Drive: Front wheel drive cars are retaining thier values more then 4 wd cards 
### Model of the car: The model of the car is not very important in the used car market as it has limited impact on price.
